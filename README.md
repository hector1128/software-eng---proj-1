This is my FIRST official website worked on by myself with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS using NO AI. 
Tools:
HTML
JS
CSS (Flexbox,Grid)

Functionality:
Used multiple HTML files to display several pages.
Used Grid/Flexbox for CSS.
Used a pinch of JS to display some things in the about me page (for practice). 

Room for Improvement:
Lots. For my next website, I plan to develop my JS. I want to use local storage to build maybe a habit/to-do tracker, working also on the DOM,
input validation, etc.
